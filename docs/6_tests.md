# Tests

[Back to summary](index.md)

First, let's take a look at the different types of tests we will be implementing.

For this, we will follow the test pyramid:
* **Unit test**: Unit test a set of classes.
* **Functional test**: Test the interface, by simulating an HTTP request.

Run all tests:
```
make tests
```
